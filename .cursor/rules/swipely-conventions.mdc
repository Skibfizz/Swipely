 # Swipely Code Conventions

## Naming

- Use "Pro" (not "Premium") for all subscription features
- View names should end with "View" (e.g., `ContentView`, `OnboardingView`)
- Manager classes handle specific functionality domains (e.g., `ProManager`)

## UI Guidelines

- Follow iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- Use SwiftUI for all UI components
- Maintain consistent styling with existing design system
- Support both light and dark mode
- Use system SF Symbols for icons when possible

## Subscription Handling

- Always check subscription status before allowing Pro features
- Use SuperwallKit's proper registration method:
  ```swift
  Superwall.shared.register(placement: "feature_name") { 
      // Code that executes when user gets access
  }
  ```
- Store subscription state in UserDefaults with standardized keys
- Set Superwall subscription status appropriately after purchases

## File Organization

- Swift UI views stored in top-level directories
- Models and managers in dedicated folders
- Extensions and utilities have their own modules
